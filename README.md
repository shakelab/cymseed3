# CyMSeed3

 `cymseed3` is a Python package for reading and writing MiniSEED files using the `libmseed` library Version 3 (currently 3.1.3). This package provides a simple and efficient interface for handling seismic data in the MiniSEED format, making it easy to import, export, and manipulate seismic records.

 ## Features

 - **Read MiniSEED Files**: Import data from MiniSEED files into Python objects for easy manipulation.
 - **Write MiniSEED Files**: Export seismic data to MiniSEED format files.
 - **Data Export**: Convert MiniSEED data to Python dictionaries for integration with other tools and workflows.
 - **Support for Multiple Data Encodings**: Handle various data encodings supported by the `libmseed` library.

 ## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Additionally, you'll need `setuptools`, `wheel`, and `cython` for building the package if you are installing from source.

### Installing cymseed3 from PyPI

The easiest way to install `cymseed3` is via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cymseed3/), using `pip`. This will download and install the latest version of the package, including all dependencies.

```bash
pip install cymseed3
```

This command will automatically handle the installation of all required dependencies, making it the preferred method for most users.

### Installing cymseed3 from Source

If you want to install `cymseed3` from source, for example, to modify the code or contribute to development, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository from GitHub.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shakelab/cymseed3.git
  cd cymseed3
  ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure to install necessary build tools and dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install setuptools wheel cython
  ```

3. **Build and Install Locally**: Use the following commands to compile Cython extensions and install the package in editable mode:

  ```bash
  python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
  pip install -e .
  ```

  This approach allows you to make changes to the source code and have them immediately available without reinstalling the package.

 ## Usage

 Hereâ€™s an example of how to use `cymseed3` to create, write, read, and export MiniSEED data:

 ```python
 from cymseed3 import MiniSeed

 # Initialise a Miniseed object
 ms = MiniSeed()

 record_dict = {
     'network' : 'OX',
     'station' : 'ABCD',
     'location' : '00',
     'channel' : 'HHZ',
     'starttime' : '2010-01-10T08:23:45.019538Z',
     'rate' : 200,
     'nsamp' : 100,
     'data' : [i for i in range(100)]
 }

 ms.import_record(record_dict)

 # Write data into binary buffer
 byte_buffer = ms.write(msformat=2, reclen=512, encoding=11)

 # Write bytes to file
 with open("my_file.mseed", "wb") as fid:
     fid.write(byte_buffer)

 # Read the file
 with open("my_file.mseed", 'rb') as fid:
     byte_buffer = fid.read()

 # Read the buffer
 ms.read(byte_buffer, verbose=1)

 # Export data to a list of dictionaries.
 rec_list = ms.export_records()

 print(rec_list[0])
 ```

 Running the example above will print the first record from the MiniSEED file as a Python dictionary, showing details like network, station, channel, and the data itself.
